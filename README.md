# Gravity Painter 🎨🪐

Gravity Painter is a simple browser-based game built with **HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript**.  
You control a gravity field using your mouse to guide a particle, collect targets, and avoid repulsors.

No libraries, no setup — just open and play.

---

## 🎮 How to Play

- Move your **mouse** to control the gravity field.
- The **white particle** is pulled toward your mouse.
- Touch the **colored circles** to collect them and gain points.
- Avoid the **red circles** (repulsors) — they push the particle away.
- The particle wraps around the screen edges.

## 🧠 Game Mechanics

- **Gravity Field**:  
  The particle accelerates toward the mouse position.

- **Targets**:  
  - Randomly placed colored circles  
  - Increase your score when collected  
  - Change the particle color on contact

- **Repulsors**:  
  - Red outlined circles  
  - Push the particle away when too close

- **Physics**:
  - Velocity-based movement
  - Light friction for smooth motion
  - Screen wrap-around instead of walls

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Download or clone the project
2. Open `gravityAssist.html` in any modern browser
3. Move your mouse and start playing

That’s it — no build steps required.

## 🛠️ Tech Used

- HTML5
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- Canvas API

---

## 📌 Notes

This project was built as a **simple experimental game** to explore:
- Canvas rendering
- Basic physics simulation
- Mouse-based interaction

Feel free to modify or extend it — power-ups, levels, or sound effects would be fun additions!
